## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling

### So, what is this anyway?

It takes the last few blocks of any EVM chain, sorts all transactions by gas price, removes the top and bottom outliers, then uses the remaining entries to calculate fast (top 10%), medium (average) and slow (bottom 10%) gas prices.

### Continued development

The methodology can probably use some work, but there's no standardized way of calculating this stuff anyway. Converting the gwei price to USD should also be pretty simple. I'm not sure if I will come back to this but it was fun little project.
